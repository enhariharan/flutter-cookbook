# flutter-cookbook

This repo was created by me to code along the examples while reading the book "Flutter Cookbook" by Simone Alessandria.

All conceptual credit belongs to the author.

If you want to see the original code examples as given in the book please see the official code repository [Flutter-Cookbook-Second-Edition](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Flutter-Cookbook-Second-Edition/tree/main).
